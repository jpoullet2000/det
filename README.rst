Based on a REST API (Swagger generated server), it provides different services such as the creation of HDFS file/folders and their underlying purge/archiving, the access of cluster services and their parameters, etc.

Overview
--------
This server was generated by the `swagger-codegen`_ project. By using the `OpenAPI-Spec`_ from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub. This is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the `Connexion`_ library on top of Flask.

Requirements
------------
Python 3.5+

Usage
-----
First you need to set up your credentials::

  echo  '{"ATLAS_LOGIN": "admin", "ATLAS_PASSWORD": "admin", "AMBARI_LOGIN": "admin", "AMBARI_PASSWORD": "admin", "DET_API_TOKEN": "mytoken"}' > ~/.credentials.json

Please modify based on your current settings.

To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:: 

  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python setup.py install
  det runserver -p 8888 


and open your browser to here:: 

  http://localhost:8888/detapi/0.0.3/ui/

Your Swagger definition lives here::

  http://localhost:8888/detapi/0.0.3/swagger.json


To launch the integration tests, use tox::
 
  sudo pip install tox
  tox


The port 8888 is often taken by other apps, especially If your are running the det server on a machine with Hortonworks or Cloudera distro. In that case, you'd better choose a different port::

  det runserver -p <port>


For a detailed usage description of the command::

  det runserver --help


Running with Docker
-------------------
To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:: 

  # building the image
  docker build -t det .

  # starting up a container
  docker run -p 8888:8888 det


Development
-----------
The API is based on the `swagger/swagger.yaml` file.
Code is generated with the `swagger code generator`_.
To run the code generator::

  java -jar <path_to_swagger-codegen-cli.jar_dir>/swagger-codegen-cli.jar generate -i det/swagger/swagger.yaml -l python-flask -o <output_dir> -c det/swagger/python_codegen_config.json
